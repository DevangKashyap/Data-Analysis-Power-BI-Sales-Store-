Data-Analysis-Power-BI-Sales-Store

Just Built a Dynamic Sales Dashboard in Power BI! 

I recently made a Super Store Sales Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI.

What it includes:

Sales insights segmented by Category, Sub-Category, and Payment Modes

Region-wise filtering for interactive data exploration

Visual breakdown of Sales, Profits, and Order Trends

Customer return patterns by city

Easy-to-read KPIs for quick decision-making

Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling, Interactive Visuals

This dashboard helps in identifying high-performing segments and cities with frequent returns, aiding in more informed business decisions.
Itâ€™s been a great learning experience in data visualization and storytelling with data!
